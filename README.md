# Puzzle_solver_using_Genetic_Algorithms

First_Version.ipynb: This version was created at the beginning of the project. The method uses naive crossover technique between the chromosomes and failes to provide a good solutino in reasonable amount of time.

Puzzle_Solver.ipynb: This is the final version of the genetic algorithm implemented in the form of a python notebook.<br />
<&nbsp;><&nbsp;>Usage:<br />
<&nbsp;><&nbsp;><&nbsp;><&nbsp;>open the notebook using Jupyter notebook and edit the location of the image file in the second tab.<br/>
<&nbsp;><&nbsp;><&nbsp;><&nbsp;>modify the block size by changing the value of blk_sz_x and blk_sz_y and run the program sequentially.
